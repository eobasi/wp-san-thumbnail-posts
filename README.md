# Wordpress San-Thumbnail Posts Plugin
Your time-saving tool for finding post with no featured image. This is perfect if you just migrated your blog to WordPress and need to see if all your post has a featured image.

The plugin works for the 'post' post type only with plans to extend it to other post types in future updates.

## ACCESS
 - You will find the plugin in the WP Admin > Post sub-menus. Click on the 'No Thumbnail' link to list your posts with no featured image.
 - Edit a post to add a featured image.
