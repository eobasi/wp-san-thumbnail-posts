# Wordpress San-Thumbnail Posts Plugin
Your time-saving tool for finding post with no featured image. This is perfect if you just migrated your blog to WordPress and need to see if all your post has a featured image.

The plugin works for the 'post' post type only with plans to extend it to other post types in future updates.

## ACCESS
 - You will find the plugin under the own menu item ‘Featured Images’
 - You can select an image in the media library with the action link ‘Bulk set as featured image’. Click on it and you can go on with the plugin.
 - You can set in ‘Settings’ which minimum user role is allowed to see the plugin in his/her administration area. You can switch between ‘Administrator’ and ‘Editor’. The default value is ‘Editor’.
